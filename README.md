##### Heart Disease Prediction
---
### Description:
###### Using 5 different algorithms we aim to predict likelyhood of a heart attack occuring on any given subject.
---
### Data Set:
###### The data used is a list of fruits (Orange, Apple, Mandarin, Lemon). This data set has many features such as weight, height, width, etc. but for our purposes we used only the width, height, fruit-name attributes. We split the data set 30-70 with 30% of data for testing and 70% for training.
